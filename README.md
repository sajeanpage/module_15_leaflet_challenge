# Module 15 Leaflet Challenge
## Summary

The United States Geological Survey (USGS), is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. For this challenge, I have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.
